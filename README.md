# Expo Router Minimal Working Example

This is a very small Expo project using **expo-router** with:

- A root `Stack` layout
- A `(tabs)` group using `Tabs`
- A `details` screen pushed on top of the tab stack
- `Link` components and `useRouter` for navigation

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

3. Open the app on a device or emulator using the Expo dev tools.
